# Changelog

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 61f1f83: **Release infra:** unify versioning and publishing into a single `changesets.yml` workflow.

  The previous `changesets.yml` only created the version PR; a separate `publish.yml` was supposed to handle npm publish on tag push. But `changesets.yml` had no `publish:` directive configured, so it never created the `vX.Y.Z` tag — meaning `publish.yml` never fired and releases stalled at the version-bump commit on `main`.

  This consolidation:

  - `changesets.yml` now declares `id-token: write`, configures `actions/setup-node` with `registry-url`, and passes `publish: pnpm release` to `changesets/action@v1`. After a release PR merges, the action calls `pnpm release` (alias for `changeset publish`) which both pushes the `vX.Y.Z` tag and runs `npm publish` with provenance.
  - `package.json#publishConfig.provenance: true` ensures `npm publish` always includes provenance attestation, no flag needed.
  - `publish.yml` removed; the tag-push pipeline is no longer needed.
  - `REPOSITORY_SETUP.md` updated to point npm Trusted Publisher at `changesets.yml` (was `publish.yml`).
  - `scripts/oss/setup-branch-protection.sh` no longer lists `analyze (javascript-typescript)` as required (it stopped running on PRs after the CI consolidation; was already removed from live branch protection).

  **Action required:** the npm Trusted Publisher config on the package (npmjs.com → package access) must be updated to reference `changesets.yml` instead of `publish.yml`. Without that update, the next release will fail at npm publish with an unauthorized error.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 946d8aa: **Types:** widen `OpenFeatureFlagValue` to include `JsonValue`.

  The public type was `boolean | string | number`, but the runtime evaluator handles object/JSON flag defaults (via `getObjectValue`) and the docs document object evaluation. The type now matches: `boolean | string | number | JsonValue` (re-exported from `@openfeature/server-sdk`). Existing callers using only primitive flag values are unaffected. Consumers can now type-safely configure JSON flags through `openFeature.publicFlags` and in-memory `variants` records.

  **Tests:** add focused unit coverage for `readOpenFeatureContextHeaders`.

  The header-validation utility (security-sensitive: it backs every `X-OF-CTX` request) had no direct unit tests. The new `test/unit/contextHeaders.test.ts` covers eleven cases: valid single-header decode, valid chunked decode, missing chunk, wrong encoding, missing sha256 header, hash mismatch, oversized payload, invalid chunk-count value, chunk count exceeding `MAX_CHUNKS`, malformed JSON inside the decoded body, and the no-context-headers no-op path. Each negative case asserts a 400 client error per the architecture's "fail-closed on invalid context" requirement.

- 84e9e53: Add PostHog and Vercel feature flag providers.

  - `type: 'posthog'` — custom OpenFeature provider built on `posthog-node@5`. Maps OpenFeature `targetingKey` → `distinctId`, context attributes → person properties, and supports groups + groupProperties. Number and object flag evaluation use PostHog's payload mechanism.
  - `type: 'vercel'` — thin wrapper around the official `VercelProvider` from `@vercel/flags-core/openfeature`. Server-side only; uses the auto-provisioned `flagsClient` by default, with optional injection for tests or custom configurations.
  - Provider SDKs (`posthog-node`, `@vercel/flags-core`, `flagsmith-nodejs`, `@openfeature/flagsmith-provider`) are now declared as **optional** peer dependencies via `peerDependenciesMeta`, so consumers only install the SDKs for the providers they actually use.

- acbcc68: **Breaking (security):** `GET /api/feature-flags/:key` no longer accepts evaluation context via the `?context=` query parameter.

  Context is now read exclusively from the validated `X-OF-CTX` request headers (same path the bulk `/api/feature-flags` endpoint already uses). The header path enforces:

  - Explicit `x-of-ctx-enc: json+gzip+base64url` encoding
  - `x-of-ctx-sha256` integrity hash
  - Size and chunk-count limits
  - 400 client errors on invalid payloads

  The query-string path bypassed all of these and risked sensitive targeting data landing in access logs, browser history, and HTTP referrer headers. The `?context=` parameter was never validated and is not used by the module's client plugin (which already sets the headers).

  **Migration:** if you were calling `/api/feature-flags/:key?context=...` directly, switch to setting the `X-OF-CTX` headers — the client plugin does this automatically when configured. The `?default=` query parameter is unchanged.

  Addresses architecture spec section: _"Context payload size/chunk limits are enforced server-side. Context integrity is verified prior to use."_

### Patch Changes

- ca40bb6: **Tooling:** add code coverage reporting via Vitest v8 provider with Codecov upload.

  - New `pnpm test:coverage` script runs the existing test suite with coverage instrumentation, emitting `text-summary`, `lcov`, and `json-summary` reports under `coverage/`.
  - Coverage scope is `src/**/*.{ts,vue}` minus tests, types, and shims. Components, composables, and Nuxt plugins are explicitly _included_ — coverage is for visibility, not vanity.
  - CI runs coverage on every push and PR via `ci.yml`'s `Test (with coverage)` step, then uploads `coverage/lcov.info` to Codecov via `codecov/codecov-action@v5`.
  - README displays a Codecov badge linking to the project's coverage page.
  - No coverage thresholds enforced — the OSS repo PRD intentionally favours visibility before gating, so contributors see drops without merge friction.

  Maintainers should set the `CODECOV_TOKEN` repository secret. Codecov works tokenless on public repos but the token improves reliability for fork PRs.

- b8ddc9f: **Security:** validate the shape of decoded `X-OF-CTX` payloads.

  `readOpenFeatureContextHeaders` previously cast the parsed JSON to `OpenFeatureClientContextPayload` without runtime validation. A syntactically valid JSON value of the wrong shape — a string, array, number, `null`, an object with a numeric `targetingKey`, or non-object `traits` — would pass the decoder and reach `evaluateFeatureFlag` as evaluation context.

  The decoder now asserts the payload is a plain object, and that `targetingKey` (when present) is a string and `traits` (when present) is a plain object. Invalid shapes throw `400 Invalid feature flag context payload` through the existing fail-closed path.

  Eight new test cases cover string/array/number/null payloads, non-string `targetingKey`, and string/array `traits`. Plus two positive cases asserting that targetingKey-only and traits-only payloads decode correctly.

- 581ff2e: **Security:** redact provider secrets from `GET /api/feature-flags/diagnostics` response.

  Previously the diagnostics endpoint returned `runtimeConfig.openFeature.providers` verbatim, including each provider's `options` and `providerOptions`. Those objects can contain credentials (Flagsmith `environmentKey`, PostHog `apiKey`). The response now exposes only `type`, `envPrefix`, `flags` (for in-memory/env providers), and a `configured: boolean` indicator per provider. Vendor-specific config and credentials are no longer reachable through this endpoint.

  If you depended on reading provider `options` from diagnostics, source them from your application's runtime config directly instead.

- e2136c8: **Fix:** honor optional peer dependencies for provider SDKs.

  The provider adapter registry previously imported every provider implementation statically, including `posthog-node`, `@vercel/flags-core`, `flagsmith-nodejs`, and `@openfeature/flagsmith-provider`. These are declared as **optional** peer dependencies via `peerDependenciesMeta`, but the static imports forced them to resolve at server startup — meaning a consumer using only `in-memory` or `env` providers would fail with `Cannot find module` if any optional SDK was absent.

  The Flagsmith, PostHog, and Vercel adapters now lazy-load their plugin modules inside `build` and `getDiagnostics` via `await import(...)`. The `in-memory` and `env` adapters keep static imports (no SDK to defer). `ProviderAdapter.build` now returns `Promise<Provider>`; `registerProviders` awaits it.

  A new `test/unit/providerLazyLoad.test.ts` regression suite proves this contract: it mocks the optional plugin modules to throw on import, then registers `in-memory` / `env` providers successfully, asserting the optional plugins were never loaded. A third case verifies that attempting to register an optional provider whose module fails to load still routes through the resilient warn-and-skip path established for misconfigured providers.

  Also updates `docs/content/getting-started/configuration.md` to include `'posthog'` and `'vercel'` in the documented `type` union and points to the per-provider docs pages.

- 9c8fe38: **Internal refactor:** introduce a provider adapter registry to eliminate hardcoded provider branches.

  Both the Nitro plugin (provider construction) and the diagnostics endpoint (flag enumeration) previously had their own `switch (provider.type)` dispatches with provider-specific imports. The diagnostics endpoint imported `fetchFlagsmithEnvironmentFlags` directly and silently returned an empty flag list for PostHog and Vercel providers (which were added without diagnostics support).

  A single `adapters` registry in `src/runtime/server/utils/providerAdapters.ts` now defines `{ build, getDiagnostics }` for every supported provider type. The Nitro plugin and diagnostics endpoint both look up adapters by `type` instead of branching on it. Adding a new provider becomes: register a new entry in the adapters map.

  PostHog and Vercel report `flags: []` in diagnostics by design (their flag catalogues are not enumerable without an evaluation context). Flagsmith continues to fetch its environment flags. In-memory and env-based providers report their configured definitions as before.

  No public API changes; no behaviour changes for consumers. Existing tests pass; 8 new unit tests cover the registry contract.

- 4e0e850: **Reliability:** provider initialization failures no longer crash request handling.

  The Nitro plugin now wraps each provider's construction in `try/catch` and skips providers that throw (e.g. Flagsmith without `FLAGSMITH_ENVIRONMENT_KEY`, PostHog without `POSTHOG_API_KEY`). Survivors are still registered through `MultiProvider` + `FirstMatchStrategy`. If every configured provider fails, no provider is registered and OpenFeature's NoopProvider returns the requested defaults — flag evaluation continues to work without throwing.

  The dispatch was also extracted to `src/runtime/server/utils/providerRegistration.ts` so the resilience behaviour is unit-testable. Sanitized warnings log only the provider type and the error message; option values (which can include credentials) are never logged.

  This addresses the architecture spec's Failure Semantics requirement: _"Provider init/evaluation errors must not crash request handling."_
