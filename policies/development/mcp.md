# MCP Tooling Policy

## Purpose

MCP servers provide authoritative, stack-specific guidance. Use them to understand APIs, components, and workflows for technologies in this repository.

## General Rules

* Use MCP servers for stack-specific questions instead of guessing or relying on memory.
* Pick the MCP server that matches the technology in scope.
* If multiple technologies are involved, consult each relevant MCP server.
* If no MCP server applies, use local specs and repository source as primary truth.
