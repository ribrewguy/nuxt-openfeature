{"id":"nuxt-openfeature-9aa","title":"Define Nuxt 4 + OpenFeature policies and foundational specs","description":"Establish missing PRD/architecture/spec structure and add Nuxt4-module/OpenFeature-specific development policies; include review of current policy coverage.","design":"Business intent (PRD target)\n- Establish clear product intent and acceptance criteria for this Nuxt 4 OpenFeature module so future implementation work does not proceed without business alignment.\n- Remove ambiguity around supported providers, runtime boundaries, and client/server responsibilities.\n\nArchitectural considerations\n- Module remains a Nuxt 4 local/packaged module with `configKey: openFeature` and explicit runtimeConfig split: server config under `runtimeConfig.openFeature`, client-safe values under `runtimeConfig.public.openFeature`.\n- Feature flag evaluation must execute on server APIs; client receives evaluated values only.\n- Context propagation from client to server uses bounded/signed header encoding; server validates size/encoding/hash before use.\n- Public consumption uses module exports/auto-imports only; no app imports from module internals.\n\nProposed behavior\n- Add missing specs hierarchy and indexes (`specs/prd`, `specs/architecture`, `specs/features`).\n- Add PRD describing outcomes, user personas, and acceptance intent.\n- Add architecture spec defining data flow, provider model, security boundaries, and non-goals.\n- Add feature spec translating PRD+architecture into concrete module behavior.\n- Add Nuxt4/OpenFeature-specific policy documents under development policies for repeatable implementation/review practice.\n\nAcceptance signals\n- Repository policy pointers resolve to existing files for PRD/architecture indexes.\n- Policy docs explicitly cover Nuxt module conventions, runtime config boundaries, provider setup, tests, and release checks.\n- Specs cross-reference each other and align to AGENTS source-of-truth ladder.\n- Documentation review section calls out existing policy gaps and how new docs resolve them.","acceptance_criteria":"Policy gaps are documented and resolved with explicit policy files; specs/prd, specs/architecture, specs/features contain baseline indexed documents for this module; documents cross-reference each other and align with AGENTS source-of-truth ladder.","notes":"Completed policy/spec baseline for Nuxt4 module + OpenFeature. Added missing PRD and architecture indexes, authored module PRD/architecture/feature specs, and documented policy review findings + remediation. Added new policies for Nuxt module development and OpenFeature governance; updated development policy index references.
